	- Look at the classification of clustering methods in the book "DATA MINING Concepts and Techniques" and consider DBSCAN and Den-Stream (explained in the book "Machine Learning for Data Streams: with Practical Examples in MOA...").
	
	- Try to classify the different clustering methods for data streams according to the classification of clustering methods made in the book "DATA MINING Concepts and Techniques"

. See "surveyFinal" too.
	- Take into account the inclusion of k-median and k-means clustering as a possible category for classifying algorithms.
	- Take into account the different window models (landmark window, sliding window, etc.) as a possible category for classifying algorithms. -> See "surveyFinal"
	- One approach to selecting data for mining data streams is called the sliding window approach. A sliding window, which may be of fixed or variable width, provides a mechanism of limiting the data to be 
	  analysed to the most recent instances. The main advantage of this technique is to prevent stale data from influencing the models obtained in the mining process.
	- Take into account incremental algorithms for classifying algorithms.
	- Take into account different types of concept drift for classifying, especially for ensemble methods (see different types of concept drift in the paper RRDWM, an ensemble method).
	- The paper "Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data (2011)" classifies the approaches proposed to handle concept-drifting data streams into blind approaches and informed approaches.
	- There are papers that deal with partially-labeled data streams. Take into account this to classify different proposals. Moreover, the document "A Survey on Ensemble Learning for Data Stream Classification (2017)"
	  mentions several proporsal for dealing with partially-labeled data streams.
        - Paper "Weighted Naïve Bayes Classifier with Forgetting for Drifting Data Streams (2015)": There is a plethora of classifiers desogned for stream analysis (both in cases of stationary and drifting ones). 
          They can be divided into the following types: drift detection algorithms, online learners, sliding window-based solutions and ensemble approaches. -> Take into account for the classification of the papers.
          The paper mentioned describes these types.
	- The adaptation strategies manage adaptation of the predictive model. They fall into two major types: blind and informed. The blind adaptation strategies adapt the model without any explicit detection of
	  changes. Blind adaptation typically uses techniques as fixed-size sliding windows that take a window size w as a parameter and periodically retrain the model with the latest w examples, and example weighting
	  that considers the importance of training examples. The informed strategies are reactive; their actions depend on whether a trigger has been flagged. Triggers can be either change detectors
	  (examples described in Section 3.2) or specific data descriptors (A survey on concept drift adaptation) -> Take into account for classification.
        - The introduction of the paper "Strict Very Fast Decision Tree: a memory conservative algorithm for data stream mining (2018)" mentions the following: Many algorithms have been proposed to handle these
	  difficulties, among them, the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) algorithm. Although the VFDT has been widely used in data stream mining, in the last years, several authors have suggested modifications
          to increase its performance, putting aside memory concerns by proposing memory-costly solutions. Besides, most data stream mining solutions have been centred around ensembles, which combine the memory
          costs of their weak learners, usually VFDTs. To reduce the memory cost, keeping the predictive performance, this study proposes the Strict VFDT (SVFDT), a novel algorithm based on the VFDT. -> Take
          into account when comparing different proposals related to decision trees with data streams.
	- The introduction of the paper "Strict Very Fast Decision Tree: a memory conservative algorithm for data stream mining (2018)" explains that SVFDT is a suitable option for data stream mining with memory
          and time limitations, recommended as a weak learner in ensemble-based solutions. In the paper "Making Data Stream Classification Tree-based Ensembles Lighter" proposes to use the Strict VFDT (SVFDT)
          algorithm as an alternative weak learner for ensemble solutions which is capable of reducing memory consumption without harming the predictive performance (common authors in both papers). -> Bear in mind
	- The paper "OVFDT with Functional Tree Leaf - Majority Class, Naive Bayes and Adaptive Hybrid Integrations (2011)" integrates OVFDT ("Optimized Very Fast Decision Tree with Balanced Classification Accuracy
          and Compact Tree Size") and Functional Tree Leaf ("Accurate decision trees for mining high-speed data streams"). -> Take into account
	- Mention ensemble methods as last methods because they reference papers from decision trees, for example.

- The document "A Survey on Supervised Classification on Data Streams" describes the difference between incremental learning and online learning. Moreover, it is a good source to look for proposals.
- The paper "RDWM" (Ensemble) explains the different types of concept drift in the introduction. It refers to different approaches for online learning in the introduction too.
- In the additional documents there is a paper about a survey on rough set theory that mentions the probability theory, the fuzzy set theory and the evidence theory.
- http://dsc.soic.indiana.edu/publications/survey_algorithms_streaming.pdf -> Information about some streaming data algorithms
- The paper "Voting Massive Collections of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Data Streams" explains different types of Bayesian classifiers. It compares them referring to the data stream approach.
- There are three basic stream processing models: landmark window model , sliding window model and damped window model [26]. The sliding window considers a fixed number of stream records, compared with landmark window model, 
it detects changes in the properties of stream records faster ( e.g. concept drift), and does not have to assign different weights to stream records (as damped window model).
- In the document "A Survey on Data Stream Clustering and Classification" there is a summary of advantages and limitations of classification algorithms.
- In the paper "Concept drift in Streaming Data Classification: Algorithms, Platforms and Issues" (not in proposals) the concept drift term is explained.

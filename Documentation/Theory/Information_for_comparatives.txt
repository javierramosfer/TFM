	- Look at the classification of clustering methods in the book "DATA MINING Concepts and Techniques" and consider DBSCAN and Den-Stream (explained in the book "Machine Learning for Data Streams: with Practical Examples in MOA...").
	
	- Try to classify the different clustering methods for data streams according to the classification of clustering methods made in the book "DATA MINING Concepts and Techniques"

. See "surveyFinal" too.
	- Take into account the inclusion of k-median and k-means clustering as a possible category for classifying algorithms.
	- Take into account the different window models (landmark window, sliding window, etc.) as a possible category for classifying algorithms. -> See "surveyFinal"
	- One approach to selecting data for mining data streams is called the sliding window approach. A sliding window, which may be of fixed or variable width, provides a mechanism of limiting the data to be 
	  analysed to the most recent instances. The main advantage of this technique is to prevent stale data from influencing the models obtained in the mining process.
	- Take into account incremental algorithms for classifying algorithms.
	- Take into account different types of concept drift for classifying, especially for ensemble methods (see different types of concept drift in the paper RRDWM, an ensemble method).
	- The paper "Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data (2011)" classifies the approaches proposed to handle concept-drifting data streams into blind approaches and informed approaches.
	- There are papers that deal with partially-labeled data streams. Take into account this to classify different proposals. Moreover, the document "A Survey on Ensemble Learning for Data Stream Classification (2017)"
	  mentions several proporsal for dealing with partially-labeled data streams.
        - Paper "Weighted Naïve Bayes Classifier with Forgetting for Drifting Data Streams (2015)": There is a plethora of classifiers desogned for stream analysis (both in cases of stationary and drifting ones). 
          They can be divided into the following types: drift detection algorithms, online learners, sliding window-based solutions and ensemble approaches. -> Take into account for the classification of the papers.
          The paper mentioned describes these types.

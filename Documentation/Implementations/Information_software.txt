Pending:
	- Check the software framework that implements many of the techniques explained in the book "Machine Learning for Data Streams: with Practical Examples in MOA (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)" available from the Web as the open-source project called MOA
	- Check VFML (http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/)
	- Check scikit-multiflow (https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/). Paper: http://jmlr.org/papers/volume19/18-251/18-251.pdf (See the table with the algorithms that are available)
	- Check Nearest Neighbor Classification for High-Speed Big Data Streams Using Spark (https://github.com/sramirez/spark-IS-streaming)	
	- C++ using the GNU C++ compiler for the implementation of the algorithms and data structures for Naïve Bayes classification and feature selection (Paper "Fast Feature Selection for Naive Bayes (2013)").

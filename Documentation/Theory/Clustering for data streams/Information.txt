	- Look at the classification of clustering methods in the book "DATA MINING Concepts and Techniques" and consider DBSCAN and Den-Stream (explained in the book "Machine Learning for Data Streams: with Practical Examples in MOA...").
	
	- Try to classify the different clustering methods for data streams according to the classification of clustering methods made in the book "DATA MINING Concepts and Techniques"

. See "surveyFinal" too.
	- Take into account the inclusion of k-median and k-means clustering as a possible category for classifying algorithms.
	- Take into account the different window models (landmark window, sliding window, etc.) as a possible category for classifying algorithms. -> See "surveyFinal"
	- Take into account incremental algorithms for classifying algorithms.

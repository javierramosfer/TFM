- If it is necessary to read different forms of estimating continuous distributions in bayesian classifiers to implement a proposal with bayesian classifiers:
	- Paper "Estimating continuous distributions in bayesian classifiers" -> For ideas
	- Paper "Incremental discretization for naïve bayes classifier" -> We could use IFFD in the proposal "Incremental Weighted Naive Bayes"
- The paper "An effective pattern-based Bayesian classifier for evolving data stream" mentions that there are three basic stream processing models: landmark window model, sliding window model and damped window model.
  The sliding window considers a fixed number of stream records, compared with landmark window model, it detects changes in the properties  of stream records faster ( e.g. concept drift), and does not have to 
  assign different weights to stream records (as damped window model), so the sliding window model is employed for efficient pattern mining in this paper. -> Se podría probar landmark windows model y damped window model.
- The documents "A Survey on Data Stream Clustering and Classification (2014)", "A Survey of Stream Classification Algorithms (2014)" and "A Survey on Supervised Classification on Data Streams (2015)" don't really address Bayesian classifiers. -> Se podría mencionar que vamos a añadir el tema
  de los clasificadores Bayesianos (además de Dynamic, Temporal, Continuous Time Bayesian Networks y Time series)
- The paper "Incremental Learning of Tree Augmented Naive Bayes Classifiers (2002)" mentions that TAN outperforms Naive Bayes while maintaining the computational simplicity on learning and classifying. Maybe we can adapt the proposal "Incremental Weighted Naive Bayes Classifiers for Data Stream (2014)"
  to TAN.
- The paper "Fast Feature Selection for Naive Bayes Classification in Data Stream Mining (2013)" provides experimental results which demonstrate that continuous feature selection for NB stream mining provides 
  high levels of predictive performance compared to once-off feature selection. We could apply a continuous feature selection to a proposal.
- The paper "Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data (2011)" apply two approaches to deal with imbalanced data: clustering-sampling and selectively recursive approach (SERA). Maybe we could
  apply them.
- The paper "Mining multi-dimensional concept drifting data streams using Bayesian network classifiers (2016)" mentions that only few multidimensional streaming methods have been introduced. We could implement a
  proposal for multidimensional Bayesian network classifiers for data streams. Moreover, the paper proposes that, in the future, it will be interesting to investigate the use of different exact or approximate inference
methods in order to alleviate the computational burden when calculating the most probable explanation. Maybe we could go in that way.

- If it is necessary to read different forms of estimating continuous distributions in bayesian classifiers to implement a proposal with bayesian classifiers:
	- Paper "Estimating continuous distributions in bayesian classifiers" -> For ideas
	- Paper "Incremental discretization for naïve bayes classifier" -> We could use IFFD in the proposal "Incremental Weighted Naive Bayes"
- The paper "An effective pattern-based Bayesian classifier for evolving data stream" mentions that there are three basic stream processing models: landmark window model, sliding window model and damped window model.
  The sliding window considers a fixed number of stream records, compared with landmark window model, it detects changes in the properties  of stream records faster ( e.g. concept drift), and does not have to 
  assign different weights to stream records (as damped window model), so the sliding window model is employed for efficient pattern mining in this paper. -> Se podría probar landmark windows model y damped window model.

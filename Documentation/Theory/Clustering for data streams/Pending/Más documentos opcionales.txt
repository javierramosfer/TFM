"In the theory community, a number of streaming algorithms for k-median and k-means clusterings have been developed:
	(1) On k-Median Clustering in High Dimensions (2006)
	(2) A PTAS for k-means clustering based on weak coresets (2007)
	(3) Coresets in Dynamic Geometric Data Streams (2005)
	(4) Clustering data streams (2000)
	(5) On coresets for k-means and k-median clustering (2004)
 Many of these algorithms are based on applying the merge-and-reduce procedure from (5) to obtain a small coreset of the data stream, i.e., a small weighted point set that approximates the points from the data stream with respect to the k-means clustering problem.

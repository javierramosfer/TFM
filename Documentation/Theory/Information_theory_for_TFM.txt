- The document "A Survey on Supervised Classification on Data Streams" describes the difference between incremental learning and online learning. Moreover, it is a good source to look for proposals.
- The paper "RDWM" (Ensemble) explains the different types of concept drift in the introduction. It refers to different approaches for online learning in the introduction too.
- In the additional documents there is a paper about a survey on rough set theory that mentions the probability theory, the fuzzy set theory and the evidence theory.
- http://dsc.soic.indiana.edu/publications/survey_algorithms_streaming.pdf -> Information about some streaming data algorithms
- The paper "Voting Massive Collections of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Data Streams" explains different types of Bayesian classifiers. It compares them referring to the data stream approach.
- There are three basic stream processing models: landmark window model , sliding window model and damped window model [26]. The sliding window considers a fixed number of stream records, compared with landmark window model, 
it detects changes in the properties of stream records faster ( e.g. concept drift), and does not have to assign different weights to stream records (as damped window model).
- In the document "A Survey on Data Stream Clustering and Classification" there is a summary of advantages and limitations of classification algorithms.
- In the paper "Concept drift in Streaming Data Classification: Algorithms, Platforms and Issues" (not in proposals) the concept drift term is explained.
- In the paper "Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data (2011)" different types of concept drift are explained (real concept drift and virtual concept drift) and possible sources of
  concept drifts (conditional change, feature change and dual change).
- The paper "Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data (2011)" mentions performance indicators over time -> Classification accuracy is the most used indicator, i.e., if there is a consistent drop
  in the accuracy, a drift is signaled. Other performance indicators, such as error rate, recall and precision have also been used.
- The paper "Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data (2011)" explains the EM algorithm.
- The paper "Weighted Naïve Bayes Classifier with Forgetting for Drifting Data Streams (2015)" mentions the three main approaches on handling streaming and drifting data.
- The paper "Mining multi-dimensional concept-drifting data streams using Bayesian network classifiers (2016)" mentions different concept drift categorizations.
- The paper "Mining multi-dimensional concept drifting data streams using Bayesian network classifiers (2016)" mentions several change detection methods that have been proposed to determine point at which the concept
  drift occurs. -> As pointed out in [16], these methods can be categorized into four groups: i) methods based on sequential analysis such as the sequential probability ratio test; ii) methods based on control
  charts or statistical process control; iii) methods based on monitoring distributions on two different time-windows such as the ADWIN algorithm; and iv) contextual methods such as the splice system.
  More details about these methods and their references can be found in [16], Section 3.2.
